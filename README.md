# BSS
A Blind Signal Separation (BSS) problem with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Fast Fourier Transform (FTT).

Inside each directory:

* "examples": example .py scripts of ICA and FFT.
* "sim analysis": .py and .m files containing analysis of simulation data (stored in ICA_params.csv).
* "toy problem": .py script BSS_toy_problem, - the main script for the methodology, along with S parameter .csv files.
* "img": images generated by the BSS_toy_problem.py.

Run BSS_toy_problem.py, uncomment plots (at the bottom) for displaying them.
